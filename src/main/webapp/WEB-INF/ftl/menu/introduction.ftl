		<h1 style="text-align:center"><strong>PALM</strong> - Personal Academic Learner Model</h1>
		<br>
		<p><strong>PALM</strong> is a web based personal lifelong learner model developed in Learning Technologies Research Group i9 of RWTH-Aachen University. The main goal of PALM is to provide comprehensive information to researchers regarding the development of their lifelong learning. </p>
		
		<p>PALM collects academic publications information from many sources, then combines and mines this information into more complete and comprehensive one. PALM applies several data mining techniques to extract some facts that related to researcher interests and the evolution of researcher interests.</p>
		
		<p>Moreover, PALM another objective is, not only to provide comprehensive information about researchers, but also to provide comprehansive information related to publications and venues (conferences/journal). In the future, PALM will also offer recommendation system that related to researcher interests. </p>

					<a href="http://lanzarote.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/palm/" target="_blank"><strong>PALM</strong></a> development began in 2013 as diploma thesis of <strong>Darko Dugošijas</strong> with title <i>"Lifelong Learner Modelling in Academic Networks"</i>.
					At first, PALM was developed in PHP with cakePHP framework, with the main goal to extract researcher's interests. In 2014, <strong> Svetoslav Evtimov</strong> 
					improved PALM's interest mining by adding new algorithms, C-Value and CorePhrase, as well as new visualizations as part of his master thesis <i>"Individual and Group Interest Mining in Academic Networks"</i>.

					PALM development was continued in 2015 by <strong>Sigit Nugraha</strong> as <strong>PALM Toolkit</strong> for his master thesis <i>"A Toolkit for Data Collection, Management, and Analytics in Academic Networks"</i>.
					The aims of his work were to provide a complete and comprehensive information about researchers, publications, and conferences as well as to provide analytics tools and data management to process and to manage information from Academic Networks.
                    In order to fulfill the requirements, PALM was redesign and redeveloped from the scratch, with Java and Spring MVC framework. All features existed on PALM were rewritten and improved. A new layout with dashboard and widget systems were introduced and many new features were also developed, 
                    such as Circle (where users can create their own dataset and choose available widgets to apply analytics and visualizations), PDF and digital libraries information extractors to improve the quality and the completeness of collected data, user's dashboard, administration's dashboards, and restful APIs. Furthermore, overall improvement also applied to system's usability, modularity, maintainability, and extensibility.

					Other features currently also being developed encompasses topics modeling by <strong>Piro Lena</strong>, recommender system and visualization improvement by <strong>Ligia Bildea</strong>, and also by others.
